	<h1>World Wide Web General</h1>
	<p>Tim suggested three main technologies that meant all computers could understand each other (HTML, URL and HTTP). All of these remain in use today.</p>
	<p> A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.</p>
	<p>The components of the URL are combined and delimited as follows: scheme://host:port/path?query </p>
	<p>A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

	<h1>Web Server</h1>
	<p>The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.[1] The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content. </p>
	<p>Web server is basically system the deals with the client’s request and provides a client with web pages by Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). URL (universal resource locator) is basically the address where you want to receive data from. When you type a URL in address bar of your web browser, the web server sends a request to the location where the domain name of this URL is saved. Then the information you requested (i.e. the webpage) is accessed and provided you by a server. This is how it works. So, we can conclude that the processing and providing a webpage to the client is the main duty of a web server.</p>
	<p>Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.
	<p>In Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville write, "We define content broadly as 'the stuff in your Web site.' This may include documents, data, applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages, archived e-mail messages, and more. And we include future stuff as well as present stuff."[1] </p>

	<h1>Web client</h1>
	<p>The web client can be said as an application or web browser (like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, Safari) which is installed in a computer and used to interact with Web servers upon user’s request. It is basically a consumer application which collects processed data from servers. A Client and a Server are two parts of a connection, these are two distinct machines, web client requests information, and the web server is basically a PC that is designed to accept requests from remote computers and send on the information requested. Web server is responsible for storing the information in order to be viewed by the clients and is also usually a Web Host. A Web host allows connections to the server to view said stored info.</p>
	
	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>The &lt;head&gt; element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the &lt;html&gt; tag and the &lt;body&gt; tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.</p>
	<p>Basically, the DOCTYPE describes the HTML that will be used in your page. The DOCTYPE tells the consuming user agent (web browsers, web crawlers, validation tools) what type of document the file is. Using it ensures that the consumer correctly parses the HTML as you intended it.</p>
	<p>An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag</p>
	<p>Usage notes. The &lt;em&gt; element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself. Typically this element is displayed in italic type</p>
	<p>Strong Element In HTML: Here's How To Identify Important Text - By default, all browsers render &lt;strong&gt; text in a bold typeface.</p>
